To create this Python project, we will need several Python files to handle different aspects of the project. Here's a breakdown of the files we might need:
1. `main.py`: This will be the main entry point of the application. It will call functions from other files and coordinate the overall flow of the application.
2. `employee.py`: This file will contain the Employee class and related methods. It will handle loading employee data from the CSV file, and it will have methods to check an employee's certifications and availability.
3. `job_position.py`: This file will contain the JobPosition class and related methods. It will handle loading job position data from the CSV file, and it will have methods to check the skills required for a job position.
4. `scheduler.py`: This file will contain the Scheduler class and related methods. It will handle the logic of assigning employees to job positions, considering the employees' certifications, availability, and the skills required for the job positions.
5. `csv_loader.py`: This file will contain functions to load data from CSV files. It will be used by the Employee and JobPosition classes to load their respective data.
6. `utils.py`: This file will contain any utility functions that might be needed, such as functions for handling dates and times.
The order of creation should be as follows:
1. `csv_loader.py`: This needs to be created first because the Employee and JobPosition classes depend on it to load their data.
2. `employee.py`: This can be created next, as it only depends on `csv_loader.py`.
3. `job_position.py`: This can be created after `employee.py`, as it also only depends on `csv_loader.py`.
4. `scheduler.py`: This depends on both `employee.py` and `job_position.py`, so it should be created after them.
5. `utils.py`: This can be created at any time, as it doesn't depend on any other files.
6. `main.py`: This should be created last, as it depends on all the other files.
Now, let's call the function with these filenames:
```typescript
functions.outputFileNames({
  fileNames: ["csv_loader.py", "employee.py", "job_position.py", "scheduler.py", "utils.py", "main.py"]
});
```
